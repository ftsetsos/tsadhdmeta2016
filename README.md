This is the repository for the files used for the TS / ADHD meta-analysis.

Here we include the original summary statistics along with the scripts used to produce the results.

The resulting SNPs were used as direct input in Variant Effect Predictor and LDOOKUP, using every resource database available on their respective websites.

The genes resulting from the previous step were used directly as the training set in the ToppFun module of ToppGene to derive functional annotation. We chose the probability density function to calculate the p-values and used a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05.
